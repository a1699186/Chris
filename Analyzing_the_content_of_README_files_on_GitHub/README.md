## Title: P8 Analyzing the content of README files on GitHub

### Supervisor: Christoph Treude
Software projects on GitHub often provide high-level documentation in the form of README files. A typical README file contains some information about the project, installation instructions, usage instructions, and links to more detailed information. The goal of this project is to systematically analyze the content of GitHub README files. In particular, this project involves the development of a desktop or web application that randomly selects a number of GitHub projects, extracts section titles and links from the corresponding README files, and presents this information in aggregated form. The results will give insights into how software developers document their projects and how documentation can be improved.
